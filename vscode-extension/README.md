# 🪟 Windows MCP Server for VS Code

**Let GitHub Copilot control Windows applications.** Click buttons, type text, toggle settings — all by name, not coordinates.

## What Can Copilot Do?

Once installed, just ask:

- "Click the Save button in Notepad"
- "Type my email in the login field"
- "Toggle Dark Mode in Settings"
- "Move this window to my second monitor"
- "Read the error message from that dialog"

## How It Works

Most automation tools take screenshots and guess where to click. That fails when windows move, themes change, or DPI is different.

Windows MCP Server uses the **Windows UI Automation API** — the same API screen readers use. It finds buttons by name, not pixels. Deterministic and reliable.

For games and custom controls without accessibility data, full screenshot + mouse + keyboard support is included.
