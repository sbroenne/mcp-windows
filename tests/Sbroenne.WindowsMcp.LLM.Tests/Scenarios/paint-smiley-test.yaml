# Test: Draw a simple diagonal line in Paint and save it
# Success = image file saved to disk (verified by filesystem tools)
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Windows 10/11 with Paint app
# - Windows MCP Server
# - Filesystem MCP Server (for verification)
# - Azure OpenAI with sufficient TPM quota (recommended: S1+ tier)
# - Environment variables set:
#   - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: Azure OpenAI endpoint
#   - TEST_RESULTS_PATH: Directory for output files

      You are an autonomous Windows automation agent. You MUST call tools to perform actions.
      NEVER claim you did something unless you called tools and got a success response.
      Start calling tools IMMEDIATELY. No planning, no explaining.

          Delete "{{TEST_RESULTS_PATH}}/line.png" if it exists, and close any existing Paint windows.

          Then open Paint, find out where the canvas area is and draw a diagonal line on the canvas, save it as "{{TEST_RESULTS_PATH}}/line.png", and close Paint.

          Finally, verify the file exists and was created within the last minute.

          Report "VERIFIED: Line saved successfully" if the file exists and was recently created.
          Report "FAILED: File not found or stale" if the file doesn't exist or is old.
