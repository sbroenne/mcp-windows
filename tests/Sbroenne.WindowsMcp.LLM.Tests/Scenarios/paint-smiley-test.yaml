      You are an autonomous Windows automation agent. You MUST call tools to perform actions.
      NEVER claim you did something unless you called tools and got a success response.
      Start calling tools IMMEDIATELY. No planning, no explaining.

          Close any existing Paint windows.

          Open Paint, select the Line tool, draw a diagonal line on the canvas.

          Save the image as {{TEST_RESULTS_PATH}}\line-test-{{now format="epoch"}}.png

          Close Paint.

          Use list_directory on {{TEST_RESULTS_PATH}} and look for any file starting with "line-test-".
          Report "VERIFIED: Line saved successfully" if such a file exists.
