          Perform this complete window management workflow:

          1. Launch Notepad (notepad.exe)
          2. Launch Calculator (calc.exe)
          3. List all windows to see both applications
          4. Minimize Notepad
          5. Maximize Calculator
          6. Restore Notepad
          7. Move Calculator to position (100, 100)
          8. Resize Notepad to 800x600
          9. Close both applications (click "Don't Save" for Notepad if prompted)
          10. Verify both applications are closed

          Report which operations succeeded and confirm both apps are closed.

# Window Activate Workflow moved to Integration/window-activate-test.yaml
# because activation behavior varies by environment (elevated windows cannot
# be activated from non-elevated processes in CI).
