# Jekyll Includes Directory

This directory contains include files for Jekyll pages.

**Note:** Some files in this directory are **auto-generated** by `build.sh`:
- `features.md` - Copied from `/FEATURES.md`
- `changelog.md` - Copied from `/vscode-extension/CHANGELOG.md`
- `contributing.md` - Copied from `/CONTRIBUTING.md`

These generated files are listed in `.gitignore` and should not be committed.
The `build.sh` script copies them before each Jekyll build to ensure the site
always reflects the latest content from the source files.
